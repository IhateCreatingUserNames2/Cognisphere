Get started with OpenRouter

OpenRouter provides a unified API that gives you access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred SDK or framework.

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards.

Using the OpenAI SDK

Python

TypeScript

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  api_key="<OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
)
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  extra_headers={
    "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>", # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
  },
  model="openai/gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
    }
  ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
